Skeleton Firefox extension written with CoffeeScript that gets compiled with a Ruby script

Based on the HelloWorld example from http://kb.mozillazine.org/Getting_started_with_extension_development.
Updating it to current best practices in Firefox 10, and wired up to use CoffeeScript and jQuery.

.project file is for opening in Aptana

Nickolay gave bash scripts to do the building but I dont know Bash so I wrote a similar thing in Ruby
